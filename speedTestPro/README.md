    static let error = Color.red
}
```

### Server Configuration
Modify test servers in `NetworkUtils.swift`:

```swift
static let defaultServers = [
    TestServer(name: "Custom Server", url: "https://your-server.com", location: "Your Location", region: "US"),
    // Add your preferred test servers
]
```

### Test Parameters
Adjust test settings in `SpeedTestManager.swift`:

```swift
private let downloadTestURL = "https://your-test-file.com/10mb.bin"
private let uploadTestURL = "https://your-upload-endpoint.com/post"
private let testTimeout: TimeInterval = 30.0 // Adjust timeout
```
