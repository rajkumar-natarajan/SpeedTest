## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Building and Running in Simulator

### Prerequisites for Local Development
Before submitting to App Store, test your app thoroughly in the iOS Simulator:

### 1. Open Project in Xcode
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/speedTestPro

# Open Xcode project
open SpeedTestPro.xcodeproj
```

### 2. Select Simulator Target
1. In Xcode, click the device/simulator selector (top toolbar)
2. Choose from available simulators:
   - **iPhone 15** (Recommended for testing)
   - **iPhone 15 Plus** 
   - **iPhone 15 Pro Max**
   - **iPad Pro** (for tablet testing)

### 3. Build and Run via Xcode
**Method 1: Using Xcode Interface**
1. Select your target simulator
2. Click the "Play" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) or press `‚åò+R`
3. Wait for build to complete
4. App launches automatically in simulator

**Method 2: Using Command Line**
```bash
# Build for iPhone 15 simulator
xcodebuild -project SpeedTestPro.xcodeproj \
  -scheme SpeedTestPro \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15,OS=latest' \
  build

# Run in simulator (after building)
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/built/SpeedTestPro.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.example.SpeedTestPro
```

### 4. Testing Checklist in Simulator
Verify the following functionality:

#### Core Features
- [ ] **Speed Test**: Tap "Start Test" and verify progress indicators
- [ ] **Results Display**: Check download/upload speeds and ping metrics
- [ ] **History View**: Navigate to history and verify past results
